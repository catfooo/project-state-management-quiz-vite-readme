# State Management Quiz

to understand state management using global state, we wanted to make use of Zustand. so we made some quiz and summary out of it. user can answer multiple choice question while submitting each choice. then, user can see the result at summary, showing how much correct answers user have. it shows also correct answers for each question. 

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

we used zustand. 
we started from showing each question and answer option.
then, we tried to find out how we can store each answer option that user chose.
and then, we figured out how to show the result at summary. 
while we plan, we focused on design.
if we had more time, we would try to understand zustand more, and probably can focus on more things like stretch goals?

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

### View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
